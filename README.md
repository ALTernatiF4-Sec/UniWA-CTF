# Introduction

## Who we are

ALTernatiF4 is a team created by [MichaelKokkos](https://github.com/MichaelKokkos) and [AlexanderSoloviev](https://github.com/AlexS51). We are two senior students in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at the University Of West Attica. We formed the team to cooperate and release our final year's thesis project under that label. Special thanks to [Ejento](https://github.com/Ejento) for helping us with his experience.

## The project
UniWA-CTF is our final year's thesis project. It's a begginer-friendly CTF challenge designed to introduce students in various terms and techniques used in the Cybersecurity field from the perspective of the attacker. We used the [RootTheBox](https://github.com/moloch--/RootTheBox) engine, which is giving the admin an easy to use GUI, allows the user to use a variety of themes, has the CyberChef tool integrated and also introduces some Gamification elements to improve user engagement.


## Free and Open-Source Software
We took the decision to use only Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS). This decision's based on the fact that we ourselves got a ton of help building that project from the FOSS community. Also most of the times that type of software comes free of charge, that helps not only us the developers but also the end-user, as he/she is not obligated to buy some licence to participate, clone or contribute to the project.
